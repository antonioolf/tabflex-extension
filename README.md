**TabFlex** is a customizable and open-source new tab extension for Google Chrome.  
It's designed to replace the default Chrome New Tab page with something **more functional**, **more beautiful**, and **completely yours**.

---

## 🚀 Motivation

The default **New Tab** page in Chrome is clean, but limited. You can only access a few frequently visited sites, and there’s minimal room for personalization or productivity enhancements.

**TabFlex** was created to solve that.

> Our goal is to offer a more flexible, feature-rich alternative to Chrome's native new tab, while keeping it lightweight and user-friendly.

Unlike many alternatives, TabFlex is **open-source**, meaning anyone can contribute, customize, or fork the project to suit their own needs.
